<h3> Summer School Day 1 </h3>

<p>The first day of the data science school will start with an introduction of Machine Learning and Data Science, introduce python, jupyter notebook and pandas and Fundamentals of IoT, Data Visualisation and a tutorial on Mechanism Design. We have practical sessions for python, pandas and jupter and data Visualisation.</p>
